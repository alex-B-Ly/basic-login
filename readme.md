# LOGIN EXERCISE

## Just messing around with this exercise - this version doesn't use Sequelize

Create an express / handlebars / node.js / mysql app with 3 views
Register - don't let someone with the same email register twice
The registration should have a first name and last name
Login
Secret Page
On the secret page, display the first and last name of the user
Only an authenticated user can see the secret page (remember sessions and middleware?)
